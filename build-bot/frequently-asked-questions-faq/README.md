### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <a href="#wxvsok28v5qo" id="wxvsok28v5qo"></a>

The FAQ section is a collection of commonly asked questions related to topics most system users are likely to inquire about repeatedly. Users are responsible for providing the system with FAQ information. Each FAQ should clearly define the question and its intended audience. While the system allows users to add multiple FAQs, it is essential to ensure that each FAQ is distinct in its purpose and target audience. Avoid using similar or identical questions phrases or semantics in FAQs.

To access the FAQs, click on the "FAQs" tab on the left menu bar of the screen. This will open the page where you can add new questions and answers.
