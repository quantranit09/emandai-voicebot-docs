Bot's Creativity: The level of creativity in the bot's responses can be adjusted by users using a sliding bar with their computer mouse.&#x20;

* When the creativity level is set to 0, the bot will generate responses using only the information from its knowledge base.&#x20;
* When the creativity level is increased above 0, the bot will incorporate external information to provide more contextual and accurate responses to customer questions.
