* **Command (Control command prompt):** You will enter the command to control how the Bot responds here, by default there will be a control command available, you can customize this control command, or ignore it, set as default determined. At the same time, the Bot will use the content in the knowledge base as a reference data source, to analyze and form appropriate answers, corresponding to the content of the question.&#x20;
* **Verbatim:** enter the specific text you want the Bot to respond to

If the user sets the answer confidence to above 10%, the bot will answer questions with confidence above 10%.

* **For answers with less than 10% confidence:** the bot will replace those answers with Verbatim or Statement information that the user has set up.&#x20;
* **In case of turning off the feature:** the bot will default to responding according to the data generated by the bot without regard to reliability.
