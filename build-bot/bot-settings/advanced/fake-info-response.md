Fake info response is a feature that allows bot control, preventing the bot from providing false or inaccurate information about businesses/individuals (for example: Phone number, Address, Website, ...)

Default: **Fake info response** feature will not be enabled. If you click on the toggle icon **Fake info response**, the system will activate this function, meaning the Bot will start checking the responses from the bot containing impersonation information or not _(This process happens completely automatically on VAgent without any additional setup required)_

* **Command (Control command prompt):** You will enter the command to control how the Bot responds here, by default there will be a control command available, you can customize this control command, or ignore it, set as default determined. At the same time, the Bot will use the content in the knowledge base as a reference data source, to analyze and form appropriate answers, corresponding to the content of the question.&#x20;
* **Verbatim:** enter the specific text you want the Bot to respond to
