# Prompt

A prompt in AI tools is a sentence or paragraph entered by the user to ask the AI chatbot to interact with customers in the given style.&#x20;

AI Chatbot combines artificial intelligence and a diverse knowledge base to analyze natural language input and provide accurate responses.

**Set up context for bots**

This feature helps to create context for the Bot

* **Position**: enter a job position for the Bot, help the Bot understand its role when advising customers
* **Workplace**: this information helps Bot understand which business he is representing
* **Language**: allows the chatbot to respond to customers in the languages configured for the bot. If the user selects "Auto-detect," the system will display two additional options:
  * Supported languages: limits the languages the system will automatically detect. When the end-user chats, the system will check if the language used is in the supported languages list. If it is, the system will respond in the detected language.
  * Default language: if the end-user uses a language that is not in the supported languages list, the system will respond in the default language.

For example, as shown in the image above, Bot acts as an adviser to take care of dogs and cats at ABC Pet Shop. The Bot can detect and interact with customers in three languages: Vietnamese, English, and Chinese. If a customer uses a language other than these three, the system will automatically respond in English.

**Job description**

Users can use this feature to configure control commands for the ChatBot. The text field in the feature already contains a default control command for the Bot. You can either customize this command or choose to keep it as the default.&#x20;

The maximum length of the Prompt is 300 tokens. The number of tokens used will be counted and displayed at the bottom of the input field.&#x20;

Additionally, users can also refer to the prompt sample to have ideas to design their own appropriate and correct prompt with their business need (see details in <mark style="color:blue;">**Prompt Samples**</mark>)
