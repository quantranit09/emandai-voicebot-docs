A knowledge base is an online library of information about a specific product, service, department, or topic. Users enter data into this system, which is then used as a reference source by the bot to build appropriate answers to customer queries. The knowledge-base stores data in the form of documents, with similar content organized into topics. This makes it easier for users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.

In the menu on the left side of the screen, → select **Knowledge base** to start generating the first data for the bot.
